9/11: Started lab 
9/15: Created the makeFile, pushed to repository. 
9/16: Started Memory.C; completed constructor and getInstance
9/17: Continued to work on Memory.C; stuck on getLong
9/18: Same as above; completed getByte. Forgot to add lab4.o to makefile.
      Adjusted makefile accordingly.
9/19: Completed Memory.C, except for getLong and putLong. 
      Adam and I worked together for ConditionCodes.C, pushed updated makeFile to repository.
      Found out Memory.c did not compile, deleted getLong, getByte, and the put methods and 
      re-evaluated and found flaws in my initial code.
      Working with power flickering and dodgy internet during hurricane probably didn't help.
 9/23: Co-Completed ConditionCodes.C, pushed with RegisterFile, still working on Memory.
9/24: Unable to push on my end due to  
    " ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first) " error.
    Adam was able to figure out what was wrong with my Memory and updated via Github
